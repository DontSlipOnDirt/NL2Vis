## ðŸ™ŒIntroduction

This is the official repository for the paper ["nvAgent: Automated Visualization from Natural Language via Collaborative Agent Workflow"](https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxx).

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework that integrates preprocessing, \textit{Visualization Query Language} (VQL) generation, and a third stage for output validation and refinement. This comprehensive approach enables *nvAgent* to manage the full complexity of the NL2Vis process, ensuring accuracy and relevance at each step.

## ðŸŽ®Demo

We conduct an web interface to demonstrate how to use ***nvAgent*** to generate visualizations from natural language description. Upload .csv files and enter your requirement to generate visualizations simply.

We implement the interface in `web_vis`, and here is an demonstration.
